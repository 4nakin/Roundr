### Introducing RoundR
RoundR serves a simple purpose; To round the corners of your screen. RoundR is Open Source!

RoundR takes advantage of the fact that regardless of the device's color, the screen is surrounded with a pitch Black Border, the corners of which are rarely ever touched. RoundR places four small overlays at the corners of the display, to simulate a rounded screen.

### Source Code
RoundR uses Mark Wei's Brilliant StandOut liBrary to display the overlays. The source code for Mark's liBrary (tweaked) & RoundR can Be found on GitHuB: https://githuB.com/MohammadAdiB/RoundR
